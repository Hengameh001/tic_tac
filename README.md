# Simple Random Forest Model on Tic-Tac-Toe Dataset

## Project Overview
Recently, I was tasked by my boss to develop a straightforward random forest model using the Tic-Tac-Toe dataset. The primary objective wasn't to fine-tune the model parameters extensively, but rather to assess how well this model could predict outcomes of future Tic-Tac-Toe games.

## Approach and Methodology
My approach involved using Python, with a focus on the `pandas` library for data manipulation and the `RandomForestClassifier` from `scikit-learn` for modeling. The dataset comprises various Tic-Tac-Toe games, and the goal is to predict the winner of each game based on the board's state.

### Data Preparation
I started by loading the Tic-Tac-Toe dataset into a pandas DataFrame. My next step was to create dummy variables for the dataset. Since the data consists of categorical variables (the state of each cell in the Tic-Tac-Toe grid), converting these into a format suitable for machine learning was crucial.

### Splitting the Data
To evaluate the model effectively, I split the data into training, validation, and testing sets. Initially, I partitioned the data into temporary training and final testing datasets, allocating 20% for testing. Further, I split the temporary training dataset into final training and validation datasets, using 25% of the data for validation. This approach ensured that I had separate datasets for training, validation, and final evaluation.

### Model Building and Validation
With the data prepared and split, I proceeded to build the random forest model. I chose the random forest for its simplicity and robustness, especially since the aim was not to delve deeply into parameter tuning. After training the model on the training set, I used the validation set to get an initial understanding of the model's performance.

## Conclusion and Future Steps
This project was an excellent exercise in building a practical machine learning model with a focus on predictive accuracy for future data. Going forward, the model could be refined further by exploring parameter tuning, feature engineering, and perhaps even trying out different algorithms for comparison.
